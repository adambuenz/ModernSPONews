The SharePoint modern news experience doesn't contain two ordinary used functions in general news distribution:

1.	Easy to use paging controls based on publication date (to accommodate approvals)
2.	Printing. But not like printing using a bunch of conversion plugins just a simple to use printing feature.

This spfx extension provides a single toolbar in a convent location styled with bootstrap that allow a user to do both of these actions in one package providing a more useful news media experience increasing adoption by more effectively driving and distributing content.
